Hello there, welcome in MarcianoNation!

🎤 I am a passonate Cyber Security guy and robotics enthusiast!
🛸 Learning everyday, currently learning to master Python and data science specialization.

My speciality is that codin is my work, my passion, my hobby. Simply if I do not study my priority coding focus topic, I do study my side ones! I love to study currently in my free time Robotics and building my OWN ROBOT! Wish me luck!!!
